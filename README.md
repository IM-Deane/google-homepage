Purpose: 
    This project will test my basic HTML and CSS skills. I am to recreate the google.com page as best I can using the elements and styles that I find on the page itself. After finishing the project I will provide a link at the bottom of this file for anyone that is interested in taking a look. Finally, I intend to add a small self-reflection about how I feel the project went. Topics may include what I did well, areas I can improve upon, what would I do differently next time, etc.

Self Reflection:
