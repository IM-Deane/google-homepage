Purpose: 
    This project will test my basic HTML and CSS skills. I am to recreate the google.com page as best I can using the elements and styles that I find on the page itself. After finishing the project I will provide a link at the bottom of this file for anyone that is interested in taking a look. Finally, I intend to add a small self-reflection about how I feel the project went. Topics may include what I did well, areas I can improve upon, what would I do differently next time, etc.


Self-Reflection:
I feel that this project was an excellent introduction to HTML and CSS. Having done the entirety of freeCodeCamp's "Responsive Web Design Certificate" course, I assumed I would breeze through this assignment with little trouble. However, that assumption quickly proved false as I learned what building a project from scratch was truly like. 

What really set me back I think, was making the mistake of trying to code the site without any real thought to the page's design and layout. Sure implementing the basic html structure and CSS styling was easy enough. But once I needed to start positioning and aligning the elements, my progress screeched to a halt. 
Not thinking about the page's layout resulted in the creation of some very messy and unintuitive CSS classes. Some of these classes would only impact one element which defeats the purpose of having a class at all. 
Another mistake that futher compounded the mess was not labeling these classes with a descriptive comment. Having a separate line that can quickly tell you what your class does is very important for keeping track of everything. Not using these handy little tools was a silly mistake that cost me a lot of time.

After awhile, things became so disorganized that I eventually scrapped the project half-way through and restarted with a simple template (version 2.0's outline contains a link).
The use of that template really turned things around for me. It allowed me to focus my efforts on the micro aspects of the project and not get bogged down in the overall design. 
Going forward, I think I will use a basic template for my next few projects until I get comfortable with the development process. Having gained a better understanding of the overall flow of front-end development, I would then begin experimenting with differnt styling options. For now I am content to have a guide that can ease the learning curve for me just a bit.

Overall, this project gave me a better understanding as to how a front-end developer creates a webpage. Yes I had a rocky start that sunk the project half-way through. But sometimes thats the only way to learn a fundemental principle. By making that mistake, I learned the importance of proper planning and why developers spend more time designing a project than they do coding it.
For the next project, I'll be sure to setup a solid design before proceeding to the next phase.
Measure twice and cut once.

Current Version: 2.3.1

Version 2.3.1
This is the final version of the project. It contains an updated README.md with a link to the projects GitHub page, as well as some final thoughts on the project.

Version 2.3:
First, I added the "Google diction" microphone icon to its rightful place on the search bar.

Next, I decided to remove the border and outline from the searchbar input element and create a "shell" element. This element would act as the visual border for the searchbar while the actual input bar would be hidden. The swap also had me relocate the hover effect to the new outer shell as well.

After this swap I shortened the width of the input element so that the text cursor is no longer hidden behind the search icon.

Finally, I added a few more pixels to the margin at the top of the searchbar shell element. This was a small, almost unnoticable tweak that brought the projects searchbox more inline with the original.


Version 2.2: 
I adjusted the alignment of the "google apps launcher" icon to be more inline with the rest of the nav-bar elements.
Solved the floating search icon problem and placed it inside the navigation bar where it belongs.
It is now in the proper position but the cursor of the text input is now hidden behind it. The next version should have a solution to this problem.

Version 2.1: 
I have successfully added the "google apps launcher" icon to the nav-bar. It isn't perfect but I may come back to it in a future version.
This version has also seen the addition of the "search" icon that is to be embedded on the left-side of the search bar. For now it is currently floating to the side but I will solve that problem soon enough.

Version 2.0:
A complete rebuild of the project. I have added 2 new files: index1.html and mystyle.css which were created using a very basic template found here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_templates.asp

This rebuild has allowed me to create a more coherent layout scheme which has drastically sped up the design process.
 
Future Version: Fin attempt to add the magnifying glass and microphone icons into the search bar. 
Following these additions, I feel that I will have completed the project to the best of my abilities.
Any subsequent versions will contain bug fixes or small changes to the styling of elements.
 
Self-Reflection:
As I said earlier, using a template has really improved the organization of the project and allowed me have greater control on the whole. Having this guide at the beginning would have eliminated much of my initial struggle with creating a CSS layout. That being said, that struggle taught me the importance of having a layout in mind before attempting to implement any code.
 
In the future I think I will continue using templates until i've gotten more comfortable with CSS. Once i've gained a good working knowledge, I will begin to experiment and try various layout methods - CSS Grids and Flexbos i'm looking at you!"
