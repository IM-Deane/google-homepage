Purpose: 
    This project will test my basic HTML and CSS skills. I am to recreate the google.com page as best I can using the elements and styles that I find on the page itself. After finishing the project I will provide a link at the bottom of this file for anyone that is interested in taking a look. Finally, I intend to add a small self-reflection about how I feel the project went. Topics may include what I did well, areas I can improve upon, what would I do differently next time, etc.


Current Version: 2.0

Version 2.0 is a complete rebuild of the project. I have added 2 new files: index1.html and mystyle.css which were created using a very basic template found here: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_templates.asp

This rebuild has allowed me to create a more coherent layout scheme which has drastically sped up the design process.
 
Future Version: The next version will have me focusing on implementing the google apps icon located in the nav bar of the original. Besides this, I will attempt to add the magnifying glass and microphone icons into the search bar. 
Following these additions, I feel that I will have completed the project to the best of my abilities.
Any subsequent versions will contain bug fixes or small changes to the styling of elements.
 
 Self-Reflection:
 As I said earlier, using a template has really improved the organization of the project and allowed me have greater control on the whole. Having this guide at the beginning would have eliminated much of my initial struggle with creating a CSS layout. That being said, that struggle taught me the importance of having a layout in mind before attempting to implement any code.
 
 In the future I think I will continue using templates until i've gotten more comfortable with CSS. Once i've gained a good working knowledge, I will begin to experiment and try various layout methods - CSS Grids and Flexbos i'm looking at you!"
